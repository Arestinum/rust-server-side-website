# rust-server-side-website

## Project Template
This is a project template using Axum and Maud package to create a site.
It is pretty barebones, so it's open for a lot of flexibility.

My hope was to eventually create some sort of framework for this. It'd still be quite open ended, but I'd like to systematically make the distinction between an API endpoint and a page endpoint. Since that this project is intended to work with HTMX.

## Goals
- [ ] Create a sort of *builder* for the endpoints.
- [ ] Decide for sure whether to go for unocss or tailwindcss.
    - [ ] If going for tailwindcss, then configurations needs to be set up. 

## Technologies for this
